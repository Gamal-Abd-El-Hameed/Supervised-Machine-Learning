# Supervised-Machine-Learning: Regression and Classification
[Coursera] [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

## About this Course
In the first course of the Machine Learning Specialization:
* Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
* Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression.

It provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)
